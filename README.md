Here I'll be be bundling all the userscripts I make for AniList.

## Install Guide

- Coming soon

## Contribution Guide

- Use `npm run watch` to build on each save. Useful when you have the userscript running from a local file <br> You can easily setup that with [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/posts/how-to-edit-scripts-with-your-favorite-editor/#install-a-local-script).

- Uses [userscripter](https://github.com/SimonAlling/userscripter) framework with TypeScript.

- Write script modules in `src/modules`.

- Add them to `src/operations` to have them run. Follow the existing formating.

- `src/helpers` has some useful tools you can utilise. Their documentation should show up in VSCode's Intellisense.

- More coming soon.
